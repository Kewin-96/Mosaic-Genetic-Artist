# Mosaic Genetic Artist
It is program which tries to generate mosaic image from input image using PSO algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization).  <br />

**Visual Studio Community 2019** <br />
**.Net Framework 4.8**  <br />
**WPF Application**  <br />

# Algorithm description
You can read about PSO algorithm here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization  <br />
Generated image consist of triangles. User chooses how many traingles has image. 1 particle in my algorithm is 1 image - particle includes positions of all points of triangles. Swarm consist of 100 particles. Colors are calculated in simple way - every time when the triange points change, the color of traingle is calculated as the average value of the color of pixels on the surface of the triangle from the original picture. <br />
